**Title**:

Disentangling adaptation from acclimation: Identification of genetic and non-genetic traits that enable environmental tolerance among populations of Atlantic sea scallop *Placopecten magellanicus*


**Objectives**:

- build and annotate the reference genome for *P. magellanicus*

- explore genome-wide evidence of population-level differentiation between southern and northern sea scallops

- identify candidate genes representative of tolerance to environmental change

- identify open-chromatin regions

- synthesize the full-omics suite (adaptive loci, open chromatin, and gene expression) and determine the contribution of genomic (adaptation) and nongenetic rapid acclimation) regulation of gene expression under warming and ocean acidification


### Repository contents
